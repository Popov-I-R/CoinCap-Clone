# Hi there! Read me, please - It's important :) 

This app uses a few apis for the real data and because the main project api is paid and the file with the keys is in gitignore, you will **not** be able to run the project successfully and most of the features will **not** work.
If you are interested to run the app and see its full potential - please **send me an email** and i will give you the keys you need to run the app with no error pages, etc...
